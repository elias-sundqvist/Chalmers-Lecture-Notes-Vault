A [[Stable]] node, as the name suggests, is a [[Node]] that is [[Stable]]. 

If $\text{Re}[\lambda_1]<0$, $\text{Re}[\lambda_2]<0$, and $\text{Im}[\lambda]=0$ the [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] is a stable node: [[Trajectory|Trajectories]] from all initial conditions move towards it in a (locally) straight trajectory.
