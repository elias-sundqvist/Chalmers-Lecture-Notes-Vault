Non-integrable billiard systems are [[Billiard Systems|billiard systems]] that are not [[Integrable Hamiltonian Systems|integrable]]

![[Non-Integrable Billiard System Square With Circle Illustration.png]]
If we introduce a circle in the middle of a [[Billiard System On A Rectangle]], the energy $(p_x^2+p_y^2)/(2m)$ is still conserved, but not the individual components $p_x^2$ and $p_y^2$ (for most initial conditions).   Therefore the system is not, in general, [[Integrable Hamiltonian Systems|integrable]].

Generally, convex surfaces cause closeby [[Trajectory|trajectories]] with closeby angles to separate.  Trajectories with small initial distance show exponential separation after many bounces. Furthermore, most trajectories become [[Aperiodic Trajectory|aperiodic]] and densely fill space. 

These systems are [[Chaotic Systems|chaotic]]
