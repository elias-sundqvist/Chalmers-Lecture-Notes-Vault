[[Fixed Points]] are *local flow properties*.

Examples of non-local flow properties are 
* [[Closed Orbit|closed orbits]]
* [[Limit Cycle|limit cycles]]

In [[Dynamical System|systems]] with [[Symmetries|symmetry]], [[Closed Orbit|closed orbits]] around [[Center|centers]] often become [[Structurally Stable|structurally stable]].
