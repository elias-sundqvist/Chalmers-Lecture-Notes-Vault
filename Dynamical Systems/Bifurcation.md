A bifurcation is a qualitative change in the dynamics (for example creation/annihilation or change in stability of fixed points) as a system parameter (called the [[Bifurcation Parameter]]) is varied. 

A [[Bifurcation Point|bifurcation point]] is the value of the parameter where the bifurcation occurs.
