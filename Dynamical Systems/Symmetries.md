Symmetries can be used to decouple variables we are not interested in. For example, spherical symmetry in a three-dimensional system allows us to write the time evolution of the radial coordinate independently from the angular coordinates, which allows us to reduce the dimensionality from $n=3$ to $n=1$

Examples of symmetries are
* [[Conservation Laws]]
* [[Volume Conservation]]
* [[Inversion Symmetry]]
* [[Time Reversal Symmetry]]
* [[Time Independence]]
* [[Space Independence]]
* [[Rotational Symmetry]]


In classical mechanics, continuous symmetries imply conservation laws ([[Noether's Theorem]])
