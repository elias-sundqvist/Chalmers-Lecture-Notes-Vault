Two-Dimensional Flows (See [[Flow]]) are [[Continuous Dynamical Systems|continuous dynamical systems]] with $n=2$.

In two dimensional flows, any [[Trajectory|trajectory]] will approach either a [[Fixed Points|fixed point]], a [[Closed Orbit|periodic orbit]] , or a union of [[Fixed Points|fixed points]] and [[Homoclinic Orbit|homo]]/[[Heteroclinic Cycle|hetero-clinic]] orbits. 

In higher dimensions infinite wandering is possible (trajectories that never repeat).
