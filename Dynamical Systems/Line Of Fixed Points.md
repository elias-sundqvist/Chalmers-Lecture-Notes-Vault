When one [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalue]], say $\lambda_1$, is zero, the system 
$\dot \xi_1=0$
$\dot \xi_2=\lambda_2\xi_2$ has a [[Line Of Fixed Points|line of fixed points]] at $\xi_2=0$
If $\lambda_2<0$ we have a [[Line Of Stable Fixed Points|line of stable fixed points]], if $\lambda_2>0$ we have a [[Line Of Unstable Fixed Points|line of unstable fixed points]].
