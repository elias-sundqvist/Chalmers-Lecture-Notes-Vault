A dissipative chaotic system is a [[Dissipative System]] that is [[Chaotic Systems|chaotic]]. 

It has a sum of [[Lyapunov Exponent|Lyapunov exponents]] that is negative ($\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\lambda_3<0$) and [[Phase Space|phase-space]] volumes shrink. 

One [[Lyapunov Exponent]] must be zero (See [[Lyapunov Exponents Of Bounded Autonomus Flows Without Attracting Fixed Points]]) and consequently $\lambda_3<0$. Now, since $\lambda_1>0$ and therefore $\lambda_1+\lambda_2>0$, we expect small areas to grow and small volumes to shrink. 

Attractors in such a system cannot be a [[Limit Cycle]] or [[Limit Torus]], since they have $\lambda_1=0$ Instead, they give rise to a new class of [[Attractor|attractors]] called [[Strange Attractors]] (Fractal Attractors)
