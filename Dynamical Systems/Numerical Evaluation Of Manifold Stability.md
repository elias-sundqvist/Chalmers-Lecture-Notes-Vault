To numerically evaluate the [[Stable Manifold|stable]]/[[Unstable Manifold|unstable]] [[Manifold Stability|manifold]]: Start close to the [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] in the [[Stable Direction|stable]]/[[Unstable Direction|unstable]] [[Direction Stability|direction]] and integrate the system backwards/forwards in time.

For example, in the non-linear system studied in [[Sketching Phase Portraits By Hand]], the [[Stable Direction|stable]]/[[Unstable Direction|unstable]] [[Direction Stability|directions]] close to the fixed points are:

As shown by the [[Nullclines|nullclines]]:

The [[Flow|flow]] aligns with the coordinate axes. Therefore, since trajectories cannot cross, the four quadrants are isolated from each other. 

Consider first the upper-right quadrant. Since the [[Flow|flow]] is negative for large values of $x$, or $y$, trajectories do not escape to infinity, and must therefore be attracted by the [[Stable Node|stable node]] at $(1,1)$ (its [[Stable Manifold]] or [[Stable Manifold|Basin Of Attraction]] is the upper right quadrant).

In particular, the [[Unstable Manifold|unstable manifolds]] of the [[Saddle Point|saddle points]] must connect with the [[Stable Node|stable node]]. As a consequence, [[Trajectory|trajectories]] become trapped on either side of these [[Manifold|manifolds]].

This is a generic behaviour, the [[Manifold|manifolds]] of [[Saddle Point|saddle points]] often divide the [[Phase Space]] into regions of qualitatively different long-term dynamics. 

One example is the [[Stable Manifold|stable manifolds]] of the two [[Saddle Point|saddle points]] along the coordinate axes: these separate dynamics that are attracted to the [[Stable Node|stable node]], from the rest of the [[Phase Plane|phase plane]] where [[Trajectory|trajectories]] run of to infinity.  The [[Stable Manifold|stable manifolds]] of the [[Saddle Point|saddle points]] are examples of [[Separatrix|separatrices]].

Note that the [[Stable Manifold|stable]] and [[Unstable Manifold|unstable]] [[Manifold Stability|manifolds]] and the [[Nullclines|nullclines]] can sometimes coincide (the coordinate axes in the example above), but in general they are different curves, also close to the [[Fixed Points|fixed point]].
