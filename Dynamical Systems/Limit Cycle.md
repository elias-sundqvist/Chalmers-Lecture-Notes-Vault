An  [[Isolated Closed Orbits|isolated closed orbit]], not containing fixed points, that attracts or repels trajectories is called a [[Limit Cycle|limit cycle]]

A limit cycle is a type of [[Non-Local Flow Properties|non-local flow property]] 

systems with limit cycles are used to model self-sustained osciallations (osciallations without external [[Periodic Forcing|periodic forcing]]), such as the firing of a pacemaker, cycles in the body, oscillating chemical reactions, and unwanted or dangerous self-excitations in mechanical systems. 

Simplest construction using uncoupled [[Polar Coordinates|polar coordinates]]. 

$\dot r = f(r)$
$\dot \theta=\omega$

where $f(r)$ has zeroes for $r>0$.
$r$ describes a [[Flows On The Line|one-dimensional system]] whose fixed points determine the stability of the limit cycles:

Note that the system above is given in terms of [[Polar Coordinates|polar coordinates]]. Limit cycles (in the [[Cartesian Coordinates]]) can not be found using linear-stability analysis $\implies$ non-local effect, non-linear terms are necessary. 
They can be [[Stable Limit Cycle|stable]], [[Unstable Limit Cycle|unstable]] and [[Half Stable Limit Cycle|half-stable]] (it is also possible to have a limit cycle from outside/inside, with a band of closed orbits on the inside/outside). 
For more non-trivial examples of limit cycles, see [[Van Der Pol Oscillator|van der Pol oscillators]].

Limit cycles are [[Structurally Stable|structurally stable]], they typically remain after small perturbations of the system. However, they can be [[Destruction Of Limit Cycles|destroyed]] / [[Creation Of Limit Cycles|created]] in collisions with other limit cycles. (As showed in the example at [[Bifurcation Of Cycles]])
