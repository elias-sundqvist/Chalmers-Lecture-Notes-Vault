See [[Cantor Set]]

In the assymetric cantor set, each iteration removes segments of different size (assymetric) from the remaining segments.

For example, here we construct a [[Cantor Set|Cantor set]] by always removing the second quarter:

Use $\epsilon_k=4^{-k}$.

The asymmetric Cantor set is constructed from two relative length scales $\lambda_a=\frac 14$ and $\lambda_b=\frac 12$

Write 

$N_{\text{box}}(\epsilon)=N_a(\epsilon)+N_b(\epsilon)$

$N_{a}(\epsilon)=$ Number of boxes of size $\epsilon$ needed to cover $\lambda_{a}$
$N_{b}(\epsilon)=$ Number of boxes of size $\epsilon$ needed to cover $\lambda_{b}$

[[Self Similarity]] $\implies$ 

$N_{\text{box}}(\epsilon/{\lambda_a})=N_a(\epsilon)$
$N_{\text{box}}(\epsilon/{\lambda_b})=N_b(\epsilon)$

i.e. to cover strip $\lambda_a$ with boxes of size $\epsilon$ is like covering the full unit interval with boxes of size $\epsilon/{\lambda_a}$.

$D_0$ is definted as the scaling exponent $N_{\text{box}}=A\epsilon^{-D_0}$
$\implies$

$\underbrace{N_{\text{box}}(\epsilon)}_{A\epsilon^{-D_0}}=\underbrace{N_a(\epsilon)}_{N_{\text{box}}(\epsilon/{\lambda_a})}+\underbrace{N_b(\epsilon)}_{N_{\text{box}}(\epsilon/\lambda_b)}$

Here $\lambda_a=1/4$ and $\lambda_b=1/2$

$1=\left(\frac 14\right)^{D_0}+\left(\frac 12\right)^{D_0}=\left(\frac 1 {2^{D_0}}\right)^2+\frac{1}{2^{D_0}}$
(Quadratic equation in $x=(1/2)^{D_0}$)
$\frac{1}{2^{D_0}}=\frac{-1\pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$
$D_0=-\frac{\ln(\frac{-1+\sqrt 5}{2})}{\ln 2}\approx 0.69$

> Note: As a comparison, the naÃ¯ve result is $\frac{\ln 3}{\ln 4}\approx 0.79$. Note that the symmetric case $\lambda_a=\lambda_b=\frac 13$ gives the middle-third result as before.
> $1=(1/3)^{D_0}+(1/3)^{D_0}=2(1/3)^{D_0}$
> $\implies D_0=\frac{\ln(1/2)}{\ln(1/3)}=\frac{\ln 2}{\ln 3}$
