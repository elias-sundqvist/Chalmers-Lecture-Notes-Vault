See [[Structural Stability]]

A [[Closed Orbit|closed orbit]] or [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] is structurally stable if it is insensitive to small perturbations in the flow. 

The dynamics of a [[Dynamical System|system]] are structurally stable if [[Closed Orbit|closed orbits]] and the number of  [[Fixed Points|fixed points]] is unchanged by a small perturbation.
