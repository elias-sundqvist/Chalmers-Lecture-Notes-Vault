*Fixed points*, also called *Equilibrium Points* or *Steady States* correspond to constant solutions of an [[Ordinary Differential Equations|ODE]]

They are [[Singular Point|singular points]] of [[Dynamical System|dynamical systems]].

Fixed points are either [[Stable Fixed Points|stable]], [[Unstable Fixed Points|unstable]], or [[Semi Stable Fixed Points|semi stable]].

Fixed points have an associated [[Index Of A Fixed Point|index]] (See [[Index Theory]])
