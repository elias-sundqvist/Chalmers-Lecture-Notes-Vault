A set with non-integer dimension is called a fractal. (See [[Fractional Dimensionality|fractal dimension]])

Fractals are [[Scale Invariant Set|scale invariant]]

Fractals (but with a [[Resolution Limit]]) are common in nature:
* Brownian motion
* Particle Aggregation
* Networks of Rivers
* Tree Branches
* Coastlines
* etc.

They are also common in "Scale free networks", such as:

* WWW
* Social Networks
* Human Brain
* Metabolic Network
* Protein Interaction Network
* etc.

They have applications in areas like
* Data Compression
* Pattern Generation
* CGI
* Fractal Antenna
