See [[Manifold Stability]]

The [[Unstable Manifold]] $M_u$ of a [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] is either a point, curve, or surface in the  in the [[Phase Plane|phase-plane]]. It is defined as the set of points (including the fixed point) that approach the fixed point in the limit $t\rightarrow -\infty$.
