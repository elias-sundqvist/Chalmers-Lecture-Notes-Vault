![[Periodic Orbit Proof Illustration.png]]

To prove that closed orbits exists we can use the [[Poincaré-Bendixon Theorem]].

To satisfy the condition that a confined trajectory exists, one can construct a [[Trapping Region|trapping region]].

If it is possible to construct a [[Trapping Region|trapping region]], then the [[Poincaré-Bendixon Theorem]] ensures that at least one [[Closed Orbit]] exists in $D$. 

As a consequence in [[Two-Dimensional Flows|two dimensions]]: Any [[Trajectory|trajectory]] will approach either a [[Fixed Points|fixed point]], a [[Periodic Orbit|periodic orbit]] , or a union of [[Fixed Points|fixed points]] and [[Homoclinic Orbit|homo]]/[[Heteroclinic Cycle|hetero-clinic]] orbits. 

In higher dimensions ininite wandering is possible (trajectories that never repeat).
