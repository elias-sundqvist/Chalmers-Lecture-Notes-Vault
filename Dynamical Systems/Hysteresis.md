Hysteresis is the dependence of the state of a system on its history. For example when a [[Catastrophe|catastrophe]] causes the system to jump to a distant [[Attractor|attractor]], but the system stays at the new [[Attractor|attractor]] even if the [[Bifurcation Parameter|parameter]] is returned to its initial value. 

The problem of hysteresis could be catastyophic for exological systems: if the system makes a big jump to a new equilibrium (for example due to human influence), it may be very hard to restore the system to its original state due to hysteresis.
