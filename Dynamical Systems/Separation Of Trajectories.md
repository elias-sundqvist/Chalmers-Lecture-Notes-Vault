Let $\mathbf \delta\equiv x'-x$ be the separation between two trajectories $\mathbf x(t)$ and $\mathbf x'(t)$:

Assume that small distance $\delta(t)\equiv|\mathbf \delta(t)|$ changes smoothly as $\delta\rightarrow 0$ ($\dot \delta$ approaches zero linearly as $\delta$ approaches zero) and neglect higher order terms in $\delta(t)$ (assume that $\delta(0)$ is small enough so that $\delta(t)$ is small for all times of consideration):

$\dot \delta(t)=h(t)\delta(t)\implies \delta(t)=\delta(0)\exp\left[\int_0^tdt'h(t')\right]$
