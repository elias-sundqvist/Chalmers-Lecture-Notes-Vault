The stability exponents of trajectory separations are the eigenvalues of the [[Deformation Matrix|defomation matrix]] $\mathbb M$,
denoted $\overset \sim \sigma_i\equiv\underset{t\rightarrow\infty}{\lim}t^{-1}\ln(\underset{i}{\text{eig}}(\mathbb M(t)))$

These share a lot of similarities, but some differences, to the [[Stability Exponent|stability exponents of fixed points]], as discussed here: [[Deformation Matrix Vs Stability Matrix]]
