The stability exponent of an [[Isolated Fixed Point|isolated fixed point]] is given by $\lambda=f'(x^*)$ and is just a constant number. 

Note that when $\lambda < 0$ the deviation from the [[Fixed Points|fixed point]]  decreases exponentially fast, but the fixed point is not reached ($\eta = 0$) in a finite time.
