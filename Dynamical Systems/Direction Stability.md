The real part of the [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] determine the [[Stability]] of a [[Fixed Points|fixed point]]. Small deviations from a [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] along an [[Eigenvector|eigenvector]] $\mathbf v_u$ corresponding to a real positive [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalue]] $\lambda_u>0$, remain in the direction of $\mathbf v_u$ and grow exponentially fast. This follows from [[2D Linear Stability Analysis]], using $(\eta, \mu)=\epsilon(t)\mathbf v_u\implies \epsilon(t)=\epsilon(0)e^{\lambda_u t}$.

The (normed) [[Eigenvector|eigenvector]] $\mathbf v_u$ is an [[Unstable Direction]] of the fixed point.

Similarly, a normed [[Eigenvector|eigenvector]] $v_s$ corresponding to $\lambda_s<0$ is a [[Stable Direction]] of the [[Fixed Points|fixed point]]: Small deviations in this direction shrink exponentially fase. For complex eigenvalues, all directions are either [[Unstable|unstable]] ($\text{Re}\;\lambda>0$) or [[Stable|stable]] ($\text{Re}\;\lambda<0$) directions of the fixed point (for dimensionality $n=2$).
