A chaotic system is a [[Dynamical System|dynamical system]] in which  [[Trajectory|trajectories]]  depend sensitively on the initial condition. Any disturbance (in physical system) or numerical inaccuracy (in numerical simulations) is exponentially amplified, which makes long-term prediction impossible. 

Chaotic systems exhibit the following properties:

* [[Trajectory|Trajectories]] have a finite probability to show [[Aperiodic Trajectory|aperiodic long-term behaviour]]. Howeverm a subset of trajectories may still be asymptotically [[Periodic Orbit|periodic]] or [[Quasiperiodic Trajectory|quasiperiodic]] in a chaotic system.
* The system is [[Deterministic System|deterministic]], the irregular behavior is due to non-linearity of system and not due to stochastic forcing. 
* Trajectories show *sensitive dependence on initial condition* ([[The Butterfly Effect]]): Quantified by a positive [[Lyapunov Exponent]]
* For [[Continuous Dynamical Systems|continous systems]], must have *dimensionality $n>2$* (otherwise we must reach a [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] or [[Closed Orbit|closed orbit]] according to the [[Poincar√©-Bendixon Theorem]])

#### Examples Of Chaotic Systems

An illustrative example of chaotic systems is [[Non-Integrable Billiard Systems|convex billiards]]. But this is far from the only example. It is more rule than exception that systems echibit chaos (often in the form of a mixture between chaotic and regular motion

Other examples are

* **Biology**: Population dynamics, Arrythmia (heart), Epilepsy (brain)
* **Physics**: Double pendulum, helium atom, three-body gravitational problem, celestial mechanics, micing of fluids, meteorological systems.
* **Computer Science**: Pseudo-Random number generators (to send secret messages)
