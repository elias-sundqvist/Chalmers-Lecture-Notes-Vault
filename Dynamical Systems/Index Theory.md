Index theory, in the context of [[Dynamical System|dynamical systems]] is the practice of using the [[Index]] over regions and [[Fixed Points|fixed points]] of [[2D Flows]] to get information about the global [[Phase Portrait]] of the flows.

### Consequences of index theory in the plane

* Closed orbits must encircle fixed points whose [[Index Of A Fixed Point|indices]] sum to $+1$ $\implies$ at least one fixed point (not a single saddle) inside any [[Closed Orbit]] in the phase plane. (See [[Double-Well Potential]] for an example)
* Sometimes index theory can be used to [[Ruling Out Closed Orbits Or Limit Cycles|rule out closed orbits]] in parts of the phase plane. (See [[Ruling Out Closed Orbits Or Limit Cycles]])
* Index theory provides information about the structure of [[Trajectory|trajectories]] around higher-order fixed points (not achievable with [[Linear Stability Analysis|Linearization]])
* Index theory is important for [[Bifurcation Theory|bifurcation theory]] to answer which types of bifurcations are allowed (next lecture).
