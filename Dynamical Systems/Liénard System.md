A Li√©nard System is a [[Dynamical System|dynamical system]] that takes the form

$\ddot x+\underbrace{f(x)}_{\text{even}}\dot x +\underbrace{g(x)}_{\text{odd}}=0$

A [[Van Der Pol Oscillator]] is a specific example of such a system.

For these types of systems, a unique [[Stable Limit Cycle|stable limit cycle]] surrounds the origin if certain criteria are fulfilled that ensure that:
* The nonlinear damping $f$ is negative for small $|x|$ and positive for large $x$
* Displacements are reduced by the non-linear restoring force $g$
