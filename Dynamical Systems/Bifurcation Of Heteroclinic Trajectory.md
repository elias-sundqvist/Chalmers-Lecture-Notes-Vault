The following system that has a bifurcation of a heteroclinic trajectory:

$\dot x = \mu+x^2-xy$
$\dot y= y^2-x^2-1$

This system has two saddle points ($\det \mathbb J=-2(x-y)^2<0$) at:
$(x^*_{\pm},y^*_{\pm})=\pm(\mu,1-\mu)/\sqrt{1-2\mu}$. When $\mu=0$, they lie on the $y$-axis, $(x^*_{\pm},y^*_{\pm})=(0,\pm 1)$, and since $\dot x=0$ along the $y$-axis, they must be connected by a [[Heteroclinic Trajectory|heteroclinic trajectory]]. When $|\mu|$ is small but non-zero, the fixed points move to either side of the $y$-axis, $(x^*_{\pm},y^*_{\pm})\approx\pm(\mu,1)$. Since $\dot x=\mu$ along the $y$-axis, the connection between the stable and unstable manifolds must be broken as seen in the following phase portrait:

The [[Topology Of Dynamical System|topology]] changes after the bifurcation: purple trajectories show solutions in $x$ form $+\infty$ to $-\infty$ for $\mu<\mu_c=0$, while after the bifurcation the system shows solutions from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$
