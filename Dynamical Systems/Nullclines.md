Nullclines are the curves defined by $\dot x = 0$ or $\dot y = 0$.

Along the nullclines the flow is either vertical $(\dot x = 0)$ or horizontal $(\dot y = 0)$. They divide the phase plane into regions where the direction of the flow is approximately known. 

|-                          |$\dot x <0$    |$\dot x =0$   |$\dot x >0$      |
|---------------|--------------     |----                   |----                       |
| $\dot y <0$|$\swarrow$|$\downarrow$|$\searrow$|
| $\dot y =0$|$\leftarrow$|$\cdot$|$\rightarrow$|
| $\dot y >0$|$\nwarrow$|$\uparrow$|$\nearrow$|

Intersection points between a nullcline with $\dot x = 0$ and one with $\dot y=0$ give the fixed points in the [[Flow|flow]].

Since trajectories are not allowed to cross, the information given by the nullclines often allows to make a qualitative plot of the dynamics.
