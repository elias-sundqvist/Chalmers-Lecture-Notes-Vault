The buckling of an elastic ruler is an example of a [[Supercritical Pitchfork Bifurcation|supercritical pitchfork bifuraction]].


Consider an up-standing perfectly [[Mirror Symmetry|mirror symmetric]] elastic ruler with a weight applied from above. Ler $r$ be the mass of the weight and let $x$ be the *"buckling angle"*.

The ruler can sustain a small weight $r$ without deformation. If $r$ is increased above a threshold (the bifurcation point $r_c$) the slightest asymmetry in the applied mass causes the ruler to buckle in the direction determined by the assymetry. When the mass is reduced again, the ruler moves back towards its original state ($x^*=0$)

If the symmetry of the ruler is not perfect, we may obtain an [[Imperfect Bifurcation|imperfect bifurcation]].

Here small initial buckling angles in either direction makes the ruler buckle towards positive $x$. However, a large enough negative initial buckling angle makes the ruler buckle in the opposite direction (Lower branch of the [[Saddle-Node Bifurcation]]). Note that if the mass is slowly decreased from this state, the ruler makes a sudden switch to positive $x$ as $r$ becomes smaller than the [[Saddle-Node Bifurcation|saddle-node]] [[Bifurcation Point|bifurcation point]]. This sudden cange in the state as the [[Bifurcation Point|bifurcation point]] is passed is a [[Catastrophe|catastrophe]] (a.k.a. [[Catastrophe|critical transition]] or [[Catastrophe|tipping point]])

If $r$ is once again increased, the ruler does not flip bakc to negative $x$ ([[Hysteresis|hysteresis]])
