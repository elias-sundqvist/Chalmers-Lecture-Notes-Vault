![[Unstable Node Illustration.png]]

An [[Unstable]] node, as the name suggests, is a [[Node]] that is [[Unstable]]. 

If $\text{Re}[\lambda_1]>0$, $\text{Re}[\lambda_2]>0$, and $\text{Im}[\lambda]=0$ the [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] is an [[Unstable]] node: [[Trajectory|Trajectories]] from all initial conditions move away from it in (locally) straight lines.
