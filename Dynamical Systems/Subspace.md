A subspace is a [[Vector Space]] that is entirely contained within another [[Vector Space|vector space]]. As a subspace is defined relative to its containing space, both are necessary to fully define one. For example $\mathbb R^2$ is a subspace of $\mathbb R^3$, but also of $\mathbb R^4,\mathbb C^2$, etc.
