Strange Attractors (a.k.a Fractal Attractors) take on a [[Fractional Dimensionality]]

Strange Attractors show self-similar structure at arbitrary small scales. ([[Fractal|fractal patterns]])

Some properties of strange attractors:
* Sensitive dependence on [[Initial Condition|initial conditions]]. Close-by trajectories and up at different places on the [[Attractor|attractor]]
* Bonded but aperiodic (periodic would imply [[Limit Cycle|limit cycle]])
* Requires [[Phase Space|phase-space]] dimensionality of $n\ge 3$. For $n<3$, trajectories cannot pass and aperiodic motion is ruled out by the [[PoincarÃ©-Bendixon Theorem]]
* Has structure at all scales (since it outlines an infinitely long aperidoic trajectory in a confined region).
* Cannot be plotted (In the sense that, there is always more structure if you zoom). Curves arbitraily close to the attractor are obtained by choosing an initial point in the [[Stable Manifold|basin of attraction]], solving the [[Flow|flow]] equations for some time to get close to the attractor, and the plotting the aperiodic dynamics for a long time. 

A system may have one or several regular or strange [[Attractor|attractors]] with different [[Stable Manifold|basins of attraction]] (the basin of attraction can itself be a fractal)..

A standard example of a system with a strange attractor is the [[Lorenz Attractor]]
