Just as [[Local Bifurcations|local bifurcations]] deal with the creation/destruction/ or change in stability of [[Fixed Points|fixed points]], global bifurcations deal with topoloogical changes in non-local regions of the flow. 

In particular, it is possible to create/destroy [[Limit Cycle|limit cycles]]. 

To find global bifurcations we typically need to use a computer.
