![[Example of Geometric Solution.png]]

The geometrical approach gives the qualitative picture.
In the example above, all trajectories end up at $\theta=0$ (or multiples of $2\pi$), unless they start exactly at an [[Unstable]] fixed point. Some details are missing but often it is enought o have qualitative information about the solution. 

Geometric visualizations in higher dimensions are typically [[Phase Portrait|phase portraits]].
