A star is a type of fixed point for [[Continuous Dynamical Systems|continuous dynamical systems]] with $n>1$.

If $\mathbb A$ (See [[Stability Matrix]]) is a multiple of the [[Unit Matrix|unit matrix]], two (arbitrary) independent [[Eigenvector|eigenvectors]] exists. The fixed point is then a star. 

If it is a negative multiple of the [[Unit Matrix|unit matrix]], it is a [[Stable Star|stable star]], and pulls all nearby [[Trajectory|trajectories]] towards the [[Fixed Points|fixed point]]. Otherwise it is an [[Unstable Star|unstable star]] and pushes all trajectories away from the fixed point.
