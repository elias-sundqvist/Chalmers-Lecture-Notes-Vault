For non-chaotic [[Continuous Dynamical Systems|systems]] of dimensionality $n=3$, the type of [[Attractor|attractor]] can be determined from the following table

|Attractor|$\lambda_1$|$\lambda_2$|$\lambda_3$|Dimension|
|----|----|----|----|
|[[Fixed Points]]|$<0$|$<0$|$<0$|$0$|
|[[Limit Cycle]]|$0$|$<0$|$<0$|$1$|
|[[Limit Torus]]|$0$|$0$|$<0$|$2$|
|[[Volume Conserving System]] with $\lambda_1\le 0$ (no attractor)|$0$|$0$|$0$|$3$|

In the case of a chaotic system $(\lambda_1>0)$ with trajectories bounded on a finite region: 

* In a [[Volume Conserving Chaotic System]], the sum of [[Lyapunov Exponent|lyapunov exponents]] is zero  ($\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\lambda_3=0$). [[Aperiodic Chaotic Trajectory|aperiodic chaotic trajectories]] (corresponding to different initial conditions) fill out space uniformly. 
* In a [[Dissipative Chaotic System|dissipative chaotic system]] One [[Lyapunov Exponent]] must be zero (See [[Lyapunov Exponents Of Bounded Autonomus Flows Without Attracting Fixed Points]]) and consequently $\lambda_3<0$. Now, since $\lambda_1>0$ and therefore $\lambda_1+\lambda_2>0$, we expect small areas to grow and small volumes to shrink. 
   Attractors in such a system cannot be a [[Limit Cycle]] or [[Limit Torus]], since they have $\lambda_1=0$. Instead, they give rise to a new class of [[Attractor|attractor]] called [[Strange Attractors]] (Fractal Attractors)
   
   
In summary, typical non-local [[Limit Set|limit sets]] are:
