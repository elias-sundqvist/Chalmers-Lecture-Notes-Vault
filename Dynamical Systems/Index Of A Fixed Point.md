Let $x^*$ be an [[Isolated Fixed Point|isolated fixed point]]. The *index of a fixed point* $I$ is equal to $I_C$ for any curve that encloses $x^*$ but does not enclose any other fixed points.

A curve $C$ surrounding $N$ [[Isolated Fixed Point|isolated fixed points]] has index $I_C=I_1+I_2+\dots+I_N$ 


### Indices of fixed points

It is possible to use the methods described in (See [[Index]]) to determine the index of the general fixed point types discussed in [[The Different Possibilites Of Linear 2d Fixed Points]].

See [[Index Of Saddle Point]] for a concrete example. 

In general, we get the following plot for the [[Delta Tau Diagram]].

Along the line $\Delta=0$ the linear system has a line of fixed point and the index cannor be defined (allowing the discontinuity in $I$ as $\Delta$ passes zero).

Fixed points corresponding to higher-order roots of $\mathbf f=0$ maye give integer values on $I$ that are different from $\pm 1$.
