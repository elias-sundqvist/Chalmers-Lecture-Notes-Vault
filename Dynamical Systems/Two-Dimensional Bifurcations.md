In addition to the 1D [[Bifurcation|bifurcations]], which relate to [[Fixed Points|fixed points]], in [[Two-Dimensional Flows|two dimensions]] there are also bifurcations of [[Closed Orbit|closed orbits]].

### 2D Bifurcations Of Fixed Points
#### Bifurcations in 1D Subspaces
The bifurcations are summarized in the following table:

The dynamics along the $x$-axis is that of 1D flows (x-component of flow plotted as black) and blue shows flow in 2D. The bifurcation diagrams show that the index is perserved.

The sum of all [[Index Of A Fixed Point|indices]] of the [[Fixed Points|fixed points]] involved in a two-dimensional bifurcation in a smooth flow must be conserved (assuming that no value of the [[Bifurcation Parameter|bifurcation parameter]] gives rise to a [[Line Of Fixed Points|line of fixed points]]). After a [[Saddle-Node Bifurcation|saddle-node bifurcation]] no [[Fixed Points|fixed points]] remain and the [[Index|index]] must be 0. This implies that only [[Fixed Points|fixed points]] with opposite signs may [[Annihilation Of Fixed Points|annihilate]]. 

[[Node|nodes]], [[Degenerate Node|degenerate nodes]], [[Spiral|spirals]], [[Center|centers]], [[Star|stars]] have index $I=+1$, while saddles have Index $I=-1$. This implies that [[Bifurcation|bifurcations]] where two [[Fixed Points|fixed points]] merge and [[Annihilation Of Fixed Points|annihilate]] consist of one [[Saddle Point|saddle]] and one [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] with $I=+1$. Moreover, since the [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] smoothly crosses zero at the [[Bifurcation|bifurcation]] ($\iff$ $\Delta$ crosses zero (See [[Delta Tau Diagram]])) the second [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] is typically a node, (unless also $\tau$ passes zero), hence the name [[Saddle-Node Bifurcation]].


[[Pitchfork bifurcation|pitchfork bifurcations]] and [[Transcritical Bifurcation|transcritical bifurcations]] can also occur in 2D, and they occur in one-dimensional subspaces in higher-dimensional systems.  Transversal directions are simply attracting or repelling.
