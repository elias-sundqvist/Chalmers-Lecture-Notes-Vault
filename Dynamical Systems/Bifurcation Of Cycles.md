Consider the equation

$\dot r = \mu r+r^3-r^5$
$\dot \theta=\omega$

Consider the [[Bifurcation|bifurcation]] as $\mu$ passes $\mu_c=-1/4$. The one-dimensional system for $r$ undergoes a [[Saddle-Node Bifurcation|saddle-node bifurcation]] at a non-zero value of $r$ $\implies$ [[Limit Cycle|limit cycles]] in the two-dimensional system bifurcate.
