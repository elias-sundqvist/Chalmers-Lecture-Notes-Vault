The possible behaviors of a dynamical system can show depends on its dimensionality. 

[[Low-Dimensional Systems|low-dimensional systems]] are often easier to analyze than [[High-Dimensional Systems|high-dimensional systems]].

The only type of system that can be solved in general is [[Flows On The Line|flows on the line]] ([[Continuous Dynamical Systems|continuous dynamical systems]])

Some methods to reduce the dimensionality of a dynamical system are
* Taking snapshots of a [[Continuous Dynamical Systems|continuous dynamical system]] when its [[Trajectory|trajectory]] intersects a chosen lower-dimensional subspace ([[Poincar√© Map]])
* Using limiting behaviour, e.g. limit of large damping. (as in [[Rigid Pendulum in a Viscous Medium|this example]])
* By finding [[Conservation Laws|conservation laws]], which implies that some combination of phase-space variables is independent of time (a [[Integral of Motion|Conserved Quantity a.k.a Integral of Motion]])
* [[Symmetries]] can also be used to decouple variables we are not interested in. For example, spherical symmetry in a three-dimensional system allows us to write the time evolution of the radial coordinate independently from the angular coordinates, which allows us to reduce the dimensionality from $n=3$ to $n=1$
