See [[Manifold]], [[Linear Manifold Stability]], [[Non-Linear Manifold Stability]]

The [[Stable Manifold]] $M_s$ of a [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] is either a point, curve, or surface in the  in the [[Phase Plane|phase-plane]]. It is defined as the set of points (including the fixed point) that approach the fixed point in the limit $t\rightarrow \infty$.

Similarly, the [[Unstable Manifold]] $M_u$ consists of the set of points that approach the fixed points in the limit $t\rightarrow -\infty$, i.e. if the flow is reversed $(t\rightarrow -t)$, then $M_s$ and $M_u$ switch stability.
