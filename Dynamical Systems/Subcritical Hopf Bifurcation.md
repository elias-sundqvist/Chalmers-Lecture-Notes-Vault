See [[Hopf Bifurcation]]

If no stable [[Limit Cycle|limit cycle]] is formed when the [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] becomes unstable, a [[Catastrophe|catastrophe]] occurs, and [[Trajectory|trajectories]] run away to a distant [[Attractor|attractor]]. 

### Example

$\dot r=\mu r + r^3+r^5$
$\dot \theta=\omega$

Non-negative zeroes at $r_0^*=0$ for all $\mu,[r^*_{\pm}]^2=(1\pm\sqrt{1+4\mu}/2)$ if $-1/4\le \mu\le 0$. When $\mu$ passes $0:$ $r_0^*$, $r_-^*$, and $-r^*_-$ merge in a [[Subcritical Pitchfork Bifurcation|subcritical pitchfork bifurcation]]. The systems settles in the distant limit cycle at $r=r^*_+$.

This system exhibits [[Hysteresis|hysteresis]], when $\mu$ becomes positive, the system jumps to a distant [[Attractor|attractor]] $r=r^*_+$. To go back to the original stable spiral, it is not enough to reduce $\mu$ below zero, it must be reduced below the [[Saddle-Node Bifurcation|saddle-node bifurcation]] at $\mu=-1/4$. The [[Bifurcation|bifurcation]] at $\mu=-1/4$ is an example of a [[Global Bifurcations|global bifurcation]]. Whether one obtains a [[Stable Limit Cycle|stable limit cycle]] after a subcritical hopf bifurcation depends on the global properties of the flow. Before the bifurcation the system always has an [[Unstable Limit Cycle|unstable limit cycle]].
