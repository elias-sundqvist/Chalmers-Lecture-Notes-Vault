Integrable Hamiltonian systems are [[Hamiltonian Systems]] that can be solved using [[Action-Angle Coordinates]].

The systems are simply [[Uncoupled Oscillators]] on (hyper) tori (See [[Flows On The Torus]]).  

An example of an integrable hamiltonian system is [[Integrable Billiard Systems]] 

It is possible to show that a $2n$-dimensional [[Hamiltonian Systems|Hamiltonian system]] is (Liouville) integrable if there exists $n$ *independent* [[Integral Of Motion|integrals of motion]]. These systems show [[Periodic Solutions|periodic]] or [[Quasiperiodic Trajectory|quasiperiodic]] motion (regular patterns)
