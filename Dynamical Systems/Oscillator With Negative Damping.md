Oscillators with negative damping are commonly used for modelling [[Self-Sustained Oscillations|self-sustrained oscillations]]. 

They take the form $\ddot x = -\mu\dot x+\omega_0^2x=0$

Where $\gamma=-\mu<0$ is the negative damping factor. 

The system for $x$ and $y=\dot x$ has an unstable spiral at the origin, blowing-up small-scale oscillations. As oscillations grow, [[Non-linear dynamical systems|non-linear]] terms may form a [[Stable Limit Cycle|stable limit cycle]] and the system shows [[Self-Sustained Oscillations|self-sustained oscillations]]
