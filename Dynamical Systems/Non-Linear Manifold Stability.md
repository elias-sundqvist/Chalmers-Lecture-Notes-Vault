For a [[Non-linear dynamical systems|non-linear system]], $M_s$ and $M_u$ (See [[Manifold Stability]]) approach the [[Manifold|manifolds]] of the [[Linear Stability Analysis|linearized]] [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] close to it, but may deviate further away dure to non-linear effects.

Example for a [[Saddle Point]]:

The [[Stable Manifold|stable]]/[[Unstable Manifold|unstable]] [[Manifold|manifold]] approaches the [[Stable Direction|stable]]/[[Unstable Direction|unstable]] [[Direction Stability|direction]] $v_s$/$v_u$ of the [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] close to the [[Fixed Points|fixed point]]. The two-dimensional   [[Stable Manifold|stable]]/[[Unstable Manifold|unstable]] [[Manifold|manifold]] of an [[Stable Fixed Points|Attractor]]/[[Unstable Fixed Points|repeller]] may become bounded.
