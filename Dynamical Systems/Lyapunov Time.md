The lyapunov time is given by $\frac{1}{|\lambda_1|}$ where $\lambda_1$ is the [[Maximal Lyapunov Exponent|maximal lyapunov exponent]].

It determines the time horizon for which system is predictable

Examples:
* Motion of planets in our solar system is [[Chaotic Systems|chaotic]], but there is no problem in predicting planet motion on the time scales of observation (Lyapupunov time $\approx$ 50 million years for our solar system).
* Weather system: Lapunov time (order of days) of same order as typical relevant time scale. (See [[The Butterfly Effect]])
* Chaotic electric circuits (milliseconds)

For some intuition on the difficulty of prediction of [[Chaotic Systems|chaotic systems]]:

An increase in the precision of initial condition $\delta(0)=\delta_0$ by factor $10^6$$\implies$ system only predictable for $2.5$ times longer (assuming a tolerance which is $10^4\cdot \delta_0$).
