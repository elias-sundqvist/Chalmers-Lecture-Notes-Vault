Self-sustained oscillations are frequent in nature and in technology, some examples being [[Stick-Slip Oscillations]],  unwanted mechanical vibrations, and [[Oscillator|oscillators]] in biology. Usually a system with self-sustained oscillations has a feedback mechanism such that small amplitude iscukkatuibs grow in size. The small oscillations are often modeled using an [[Oscillator With Negative Damping|oscillator with negative dampting]]. One simple and common model in mathematics, physics, engineering, biology and economic theory, is the [[Van Der Pol Oscillator|van der Pol oscillator]].
