In a [[Linear Dynamical Systems|linear system]] the [[Stable Manifold|stable]]/[[Unstable Manifold|unstable]] [[Manifold|manifold]] is given by the [[Subspace|subspace]] spanned by the set of [[Stable Direction|stable]] / [[Unstable Direction|unstable]] [[Direction Stability|directions]]. For example, a [[Saddle Point|saddle point]] has one negative and one positive [[Eigenvalue|eivenvalue]], it attracts along the [[Stable Direction|stable direction]], but repels along the [[Unstable Direction|unstable direction]]. Its stable and unstable manifolds are lines in these directions. [[Stable Fixed Points|Attractors]]/[[Unstable Fixed Points|repellers]] are [[Stable|stable]]/[[Unstable|unstable]] in all directions and the [[Stable Manifold|stable]]/[[Unstable Manifold|unstable]] [[Manifold Stability|manifold]] is a surface (the entire phase plane).
