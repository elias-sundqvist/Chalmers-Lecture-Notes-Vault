A [[Stable Fixed Points|stable fixed point]] has $\text{Re}[\lambda_{1,2}]<0$. A bifurcation to an [[Unstable Fixed Points|unstable fixed point]] occurs if the maximal [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalue]] crosses zero. Consider the three possible bifurcations from stable to unstable in a linear system as illustrated below:

Case C is called a hopf bifurcation: which is a new type of [[Bifurcation|bifurcation]] that does not exist in [[Flows On The Line|1D]].

Considering a bifurcation having $\text{Im}[\lambda_{1,2}]\ne0$ in a [[Linear Dynamical Systems|linear system]] results in the following diagram:

Hopf bifurcations often lead to the formation of [[Limit Cycle|limit cycles]]. The bifurcation can either be [[Supercirical Hopf Bifurcation|supercritical]] of [[Subcritical Hopf Bifurcation|subcritical]]
