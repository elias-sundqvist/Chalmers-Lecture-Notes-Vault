By introducing periodic boundaries (for example at $\theta=0$ and $\theta=2\pi$) to a one-dimensional dynamical system (See [[Flows On The Line]]), we obtain a flow on the circle. Such flows behave as the [[Flows On The Line|flow on the line]], with the additional property that it allows for [[Periodic Solutions|periodic solutions]], one example being $\dot \theta=\text{const}$. With periodicity $2\pi$.
