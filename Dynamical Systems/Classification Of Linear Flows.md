[[Two-Dimensional Flows|Two-dimensional flows]] have several additional types of [[Fixed Points|fixed points]] compared to [[Flows On The Line|one-dimensional flows]]. 

To find all possible types, consider a general linear flow (neglect constant terms, since they correspond to constant shifts in $x$ and $y$):

$\dot x = ax+by$
$\dot y = cx+dy$

See [[Analytic Solutions To Linear 2D Flows]]

The solutions $\mathbb \xi(t)$ show the prototypic behaviour of [[Trajectory|trajectories]] in linear systems and is quanitfied by $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ (the eigenvalues determined by the [[Characteristic Equation|characteristic equation]].).
In the solution of the original problem $\mathbf x(t)=\mathbb P\mathbf \xi(t)$, directions are rotated and rescaled compared to $\mathbf \xi$, but the [[Topology Of Dynamical System|topological properties]] of the system are the same (structure and [[Trajectory|trajectories]] are rotated and stretched but the relative order between [[Trajectory|trajectories]] remain intact)

This gives us a "Zoo"/"Taxonomy" for different types of fixed points in [[Linear 2D Flows|linear 2d flows]].
