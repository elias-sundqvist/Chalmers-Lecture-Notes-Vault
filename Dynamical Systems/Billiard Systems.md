In billiard systems a particle has constant velocity until it hits a boundary, where it bounces using the law of reflection (incident angle $\theta_i=\text{outgoing angle }\theta_o$)

Billiard systems are important as simple models for problems in optics, statistical physics (gasses), electrons in metal (Lorentz gas), etc. 

They are examples of [[Hamiltonian Systems]]

$H(\mathbf x,\mathbf p)=\frac{p^2}{2m}+V(\mathbf x)$, with $V(\mathbf x)=\cases{i&Inside billiard area\\\infty & At walls}$

The type of dynamics depend on the geometry of the billiard table.
