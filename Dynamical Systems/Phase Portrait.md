A phase portrait is a [[Geometrical Approach|geometrical visualization]] of a (typically 2d) [[Continuous Dynamical Systems|continus dynamical system]].

The trajectories are obtained by integration of the dynamical system starting from a suitable set of initial positions ($x_0,y_0$) (Or by using [[StreamPlot]] in Mathematica)
