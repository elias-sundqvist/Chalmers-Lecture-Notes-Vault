Assume a smooth flow in a bounded domain $D$ of the plane. Assume further that $D$ does not contain any [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] and that there exists a [[Trajectory|trajectory]] that is confined in $D$ for all times. Then at least one [[Periodic Orbit]] exists in $D$. This is a consequence of the fact that trajectories for smooth flow cannot intersect in two dimensions. 


This can be used to prove the existence of [[Closed Orbit|closed orbits]]. See [[Proving The Existence Of Closed Orbits]].
