A standard exaple of a [[Stretch And Fold Mechanism]]|stretch and fold mechanism is the simple horseshoe map.  (which can be seen as the repeated mapping of a rectangle onto itself)

The simple horseshoe map can be created by the following steps:

![[Simple Horseshoe Map Illustration.png]]

* Map rectangle $abcd$ into a horseshoe $a'b'c'd'$ by stretching and folding as above. The area of the horseshoe is smaller than the original image (so the sytem is [[Dissipative System|dissipative]])
* Apply the map again by stretching and folding the horse show
* Repeat this to get thinner and thinner filaments


After infinite iterations, a vertical cut through the middle resembles a [[Fractal]] (A topological deformation of the [[Cantor Set]])

This is a typical situation: locally the strange attractor consists of a bundle of a large (infinite) number of close-to parallel filaments. By outting an $n-1$ dimensional cross-section through the bundle a fractal pattern emerges.
