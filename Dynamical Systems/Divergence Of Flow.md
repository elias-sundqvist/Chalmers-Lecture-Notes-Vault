**Divergence Of Flow (a.k.a phase space contraction)**

A [[Flow|flow]] $\mathbf f$ that has divergence $\nabla \cdot \mathbf f(\mathbf x)=0$ everywhere is [[Volume Conserving System|volume conserving]].

If it has divergence  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf f(\mathbf x)<0$ somewhere, it is called [[Dissipative System]]
