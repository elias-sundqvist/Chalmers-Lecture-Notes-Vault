The standard example of a system with a [[Strange Attractors|strange attractor]] is

$\dot x =\sigma(y-x)$
$\dot y=rx-y-xz$
$\dot z=xy-bz$

This is a toy model for convection rolls in the atmosphere. 
It also describes the motion of a particular water wheel. 

Attracting fixed points exist for small $r$, but the system jumps to a [[Strange Attractors|strange attractor]] after a [[Subcritical Hopf Bifurcation|subcritical hopf bifurcation]] at $r_H$ (the value of $r_H$ depends on $\sigma$ and $b$).
