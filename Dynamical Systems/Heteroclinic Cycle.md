![[Heteroclinic Cycle Illustration.png]]

Two or more [[Heteroclinic Trajectory|heteroclinic trajectories]] can join to form a closed region.  The border created by these trajectories is called a heteroclinic cycle. 

A heteroclinic cycle is not strictly periodic since it takes an infinite amount of time to reach a fixed point on the cycle. 

Heteroclinic cycles can attract (or repel) other [[Trajectory|trajectories]], or act as divisors between regions of different kinds of dynamics ([[Separatrix|separatrices]]).

In the example above they are separating a band of closed orbits from other trajectories. It is also possible that [[Isolated Closed Orbits]], not containing fixed points, attract or repel trajectories. Such orbits are [[Limit Cycle|limit cycles]]
