A catastrophe is when a small change in a [[Bifurcation Parameter|parameter]] of a [[Dynamical System|dynamical system]] causes the system to suddenly jump to a distant [[Attractor|attractor]].  ([[Fixed Points|fixed point]], [[Limit Cycle|limit cycle]], [[Infinity|infinity]], or [[Strange Attractors|strange attractor]] (for $d>2$))


A sudden change in equilibrium could be catastrophic for buildings and other constructions
