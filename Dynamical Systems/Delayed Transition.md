A [[Dynamical System|dynamical system]] has a delayed transition if it seems to be in equilibrium while it is in reality slowly moving towards another [[Fixed Points|fixed point]]. One example is a biological population believed to be in equilibrium conditions ([[Ghost Of Fixed Points|ghost of a fixed point]]), but in reality is on the route to extinction ([[Stable Fixed Points|stable fixed point]]). Another example is chemical reactions where reactants slowly transform into productis.
