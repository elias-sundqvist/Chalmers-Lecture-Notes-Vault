![[Double Well Potential Illustration.png]]
The illustration above is a [[Double-Well Potential]]. 
A and C are examples of non-linear centers.

[[Isolated Fixed Point|Isolated]] [[Center|centers]] in [[Hamiltonian Systems|Hamiltonian systems]] are robust to non-linear perturbations. They are surrounded by a band of [[Closed Orbit|Closed orbits]] despite the non-linear terms. The [[Closed Orbit|closed orbits]] around the centers correspond to small oscillations around the [[Potential Minimum|potential minima]].
