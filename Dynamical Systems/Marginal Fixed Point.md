A Marginal Fixed point is a [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] where $\frac{d\dot x}{dx}=0$.
[[Semi Stable Fixed Points|Semi stable fixed points]] are marginal fixed points, but the other way around is not necessarily true. For example $\dot x = x^3$ is marginal but still [[Unstable Fixed Points|unstable]]. 

In general [[Linear Stability Analysis|linear stability analysis]] is not enough to determine the stability of marginal fixed points.
