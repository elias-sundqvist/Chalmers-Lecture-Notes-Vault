### The Double-Well Potential

In [[Frictionless Mechanics]], we can choose the [[Potential]] $V(x)$ to equal $-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{4}$.

The paths in the [[Phase Plane|phase plane]] are contours of constant $H(x)=\frac{p^2}{2}-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{4}=E$

* (A,C) are [[Center|centers]] ([[Potential Minimum|potential minima]])
* (B) is a [[Saddle Point|saddle]] ([[Potential Maximum]])

[[Isolated Fixed Point|Isolated]] [[Center|centers]] in [[Hamiltonian Systems|Hamiltonian systems]] are robust to non-linear perturbations (See [[Non-Linear Centers]])

The [[Stable Manifold|stable]] and [[Unstable Manifold|unstable]] [[Manifold Stability|manifold]] of the [[Saddle Point|saddle point]] connect at the [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] and form a [[Homoclinic Orbit]]

The two homoclinic orbits serve as [[Separatrix|separatrices]]. Outside of them, the system has high enough energy to make large-amplitude oscillations over both [[Potential Minimum|potential minima]].

The following image illustrates the [[Index Of A Fixed Point|indices]] of the double-well potential [[Fixed Points|fixed points]]:

[[Closed Orbit|Closed orbits]] may surround the centers (+1 each), or surround both [[Center|centers]] and the [[Saddle Point|saddle]] ($I_C=2\cdot (+1)-1=+1$). [[Trajectory|Trajectories]] surrounding one [[Center|center]] and one [[Saddle Point|saddle]] can not happen. The separating [[Homoclinic Orbit|homoclinic orbits]] do not have well defined [[Index|indices]] (the curves cross the fixed point).
