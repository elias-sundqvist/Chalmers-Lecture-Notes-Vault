In a [[Billiard Systems|billiard system]] where the geometry of the billiard table is an ellipse, kinetic energy $p^2/(2m)$ and angular momentum w.r.t. the two foci are [[Integral Of Motion|integrals of motion]]

Since the dimensionality $d=2$ and there are $d$ independent integrals of motion, this is an [[Integrable Billiard Systems|integrable billiard system]].
