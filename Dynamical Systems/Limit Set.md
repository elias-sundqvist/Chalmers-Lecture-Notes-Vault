The limit set is the set of points a trajectory can visit in the limit $t\rightarrow \infty$. The difference between a [[Limit Set]] and an [[Attractor]] is that limit sets don't require an open set of initial conditions around the set whose trajectories enter the set. 

See example 2 in ([[Attractor]]) for one example

Other examples of limit sets that are not [[Attractor|attractors]] are
* [[Closed Orbit|Closed Orbits]]
* [[Half Stable Limit Cycle|Half Stable Limit Cycles]]
* [[Semi Stable Fixed Points|Half Stable Fixed Points]]

Typical non-local limit sets are as follows:
