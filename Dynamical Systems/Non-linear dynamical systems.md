Mopst real-world systems are (at least to some degree) non-linear.
Allows for new types of solutions compared to [[Linear Dynamical Systems]].

Examples:
* Large-amplitude oscillations of [[Simple Pendulum]].
* Large-amplitude oscillations of double pendulum.

In these cases the angle of a single pendulum can no longer be well approximated by $A\cos(\omega t)$

The motion of a double pendulum becomes [[Chaos|chaotic]].
