A bifurcation diagram is a plot of fixed points against the [[Bifurcation Parameter|bifurcation parameter]]

Below is an example of a bifurcation diagram (but they are often plotted without the blue flow):

In bifurcation diagrams, solid lines denote [[Stable Fixed Points|stable fixed points]] and dashed lines denote [[Unstable Fixed Points|unstable]] ones. As a [[Bifurcation Parameter|bifurcation parameter]] $r$ passes through the [[Bifurcation Point|bifurcation point]] $r_c$, two fixed points (one [[Unstable Fixed Points|unstable]] and one [[Stable Fixed Points|stable]]) merge and dissapear: This is an example of a [[Saddle-Node Bifurcation]]. [[Saddle-Node Bifurcation|Saddle-node bifurcations]] are the typical mechanism for [[Creation Of Fixed Points|creation]]/[[Annihilation Of Fixed Points|annihilation]] of [[Fixed Points|fixed points]].
