Integrable billiard systems are [[Billiard Systems]] that are [[Integrable Hamiltonian Systems|Integrable]].

Examples of Integrable billiard systems are

* [[Billiard System On A Rectangle]]
* [[Billiard System On A Circle]]
* [[Billiard System On An Ellipse]]


Integrable motion is always predictable. Two close-by initial conditions stay together for a large time (they may spearate, but not exponentially fast)

Note: If the billiard table is two-dimensional, we have a four-dimensional dynamical system $(x,y,v_x,v_y)$. We plot a two dimensional projection which makes it look like trajectories cross, but they do not in the four-dimensional [[Phase Space|phase space]].
