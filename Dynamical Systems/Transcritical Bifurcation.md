A transcritical bifurcation is a [[Bifurcation|bifurcation]] which occurs when a [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] exists for all values of a [[Bifurcation Parameter|bifurcation parameter]] $r$ surrounding $r_c$, but [[Change In Fixed Point Stability|changes stability]], as $r$ passes $r_c$. As for the [[Saddle-Node Bifurcation|saddle-node bifuraction]], it is possible to derive a [[Normal Form Of Bifurcations|normal form]] valid close to any transcritical bifurcation. (See [[Normal Form of Transcritical Bifurcation]])

The normal form has a fixed point at $x^*=0$ for all values of $r$, but stability changes as $r$ passes the [[Bifurcation Point|bifurcation point]].
