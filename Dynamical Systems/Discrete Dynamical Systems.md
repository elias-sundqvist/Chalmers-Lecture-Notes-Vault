A discrete dynamical system can be written as a set of coupled recurrence equations (in vector form).

$\mathbf x_{i+1}=\mathbf F(\mathbf x_i)$

$\mathbf x_i\equiv x_{1,i},\dots, x_{n,i}$ denotes $n$ [[Phase Space|phase-space]] variables at discrete times $i=0,1,\dots$

The functions $\mathbf F=(F_1,\dots,F_n)$ are called a [[Map|map]] (from $\mathbf x_i$ to $\mathbf x_{i+1}$). 
And the solution $\mathbf x_i$ starting from $\mathbf x_0$ is called [[Orbit|orbit]].

Discrete dynamical systems appear upon discretisation of continuous dynamical systems, or by themselves, for example $x_i$ could denote the population of some species in a given year $i$.
