If $\text{Re}[\lambda_1]>0$ and $\text{Re}[\lambda_2]<0$ the [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] is a  [[Saddle Point|saddle point]]: It attracts in one direction and repels in another. 

The [[Index Of A Fixed Point|index]] of a saddle point is $I=-1$. (See [[Index Of Saddle Point]] for more details)

A saddle point is technically [[Unstable]] since it has a positive eigenvalue. 

 The [[Manifold|manifolds]] (See [[Manifold Stability]]) of saddle points often divide the [[Phase Space]] into regions of qualitatively different long-term dynamics. (See [[Numerical Evaluation Of Manifold Stability]])

Side remark: The name of the fixed point is "saddle point" or simply "saddle", not "Saddle Node", as is common notation of the inexperienced student. [[Saddle-Node Bifurcation|saddle-node bifurcations]] refer to the bifurcation between two fixed points: A [[Saddle Point|saddle]] and a [[Node]]

For saddles, one can safely use [[Linear Stability Analysis]]
