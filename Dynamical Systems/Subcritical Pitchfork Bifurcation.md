A subcritical pitchfork bifurcation is a [[Pitchfork bifurcation]] which has one [[Unstable]] branch splitting into one [[Stable]]- and two [[Unstable]] branches (the [[Stable]] one being in the middle)

As for the [[Supercritical Pitchfork Bifurcation|supercritical case]], we have a [[Stable]] fixed point at $x^*=0$ for $r<r_c$. When $r$ passes $r_c$ there are no [[Stable]] fixed points and a small deviation from $x=0$ grows to infinity in a finite time ([[Blow-Up|blow-up]] due to cubic dynamics). Most physical systems have higher-order non-linear corrections that counteract the blow-up (the pitchfork bifurcation happens locally at small $x$ and the system may have other fixed points at larger values of $|x|$). However, the system must make a jump to the new [[Fixed Points|fixed point]], making subcritical pitchfork bifurcations potentially dangerous.
