The dynamics of a [[Dynamical System|system]] are [[Structurally Stable|structurally stable]] if [[Closed Orbit|closed orbits]] and the number of  [[Fixed Points|fixed points]] is unchanged by a small perturbation. 

They are [[Structurally Unstable|structurally unstable]] if a small perturbation may change [[Closed Orbit|closed orbits]] and the number of  [[Fixed Points|fixed points]].
