A periodic orbit is a [[Trajectory]] that returns to its initial position periodically. 

In other words, it has a periodic solution $\mathbf x(t)=\mathbf x(t+T)$, where $T$ is the period time. 

The most common type of periodic orbit is a [[Closed Orbit|closed orbit]],
but other types of periodic orbits can exist under certain conditions, such as [[Rotations|rotations]].
