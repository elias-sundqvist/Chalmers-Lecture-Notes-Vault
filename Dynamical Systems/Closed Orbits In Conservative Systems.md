The following holds for [[Two-Dimensional Flows|two dimensional]] [[Conservative Systems|conservative systems]]. $\dot{\mathbf x}=\mathbf f(\mathbf x)$ with smooth $\mathbf f$:

If $\mathbf x^*$ is an [[Isolated Fixed Point|isolated fixed point]] and $E(\mathbf x)$ is a local minimum of $E$, then the paths in the vicinity of $\mathbf x^*$ are closed.
