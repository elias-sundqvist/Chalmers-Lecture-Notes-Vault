Flows on the line (See [[Flow]]) are [[Continuous Dynamical Systems|continuous dynamical systems]] with $n=1$.

These are the only type of dynamical systems that can be solved in general, by [[Separation of Variables|separation of variables]]: $\frac{dx}{f(x)}=dt$
There is an [[Existence and Uniqueness Theorem]] that states that there exists unique solution starting from any initial conditions. 

$f$ is smooth and real-valued. $x$ takes any real value. There is no explicit time dependence in $f$. The [[Rigid Pendulum in a Viscous Medium|overdamped pendulum]] is one example. 


The trajectories resulting from a smooth flow on the line can not cross. The reason is that for each point in space the solution moves in a unique direction determined by the flow. As a result.
*  [[Trajectory|Trajectories]] move monotonically towards [[Fixed Points|fixed points]] or towards plus/minus infinity
* No [[Oscillatory Motion]] is possible. 
	* Note however: By introducing periodic boundaries (for example at $\theta=0$ and $\theta=2\pi$) to a one-dimensional dynamical system, we obtain a [[Flows On The Circle|flow on the circle]]. Such flows behave as the flows on the line, with the additional property that they allow for [[Periodic Solutions|periodic solutions]], one example being $\dot \theta=\text{const}$. With periodicity $2\pi$.


Note that the direction of a flow on the line is uniquely determined everywhere by its [[Fixed Points|fixed points]].  [[Bifurcation|Bifurcations]] only occur when fixed points are [[Creation Of Fixed Points|created]], [[Annihilation Of Fixed Points|destroyed]], or [[Change In Fixed Point Stability|change stability]]. All these require $f'(x^*)=0$, which is a *necessary condition for bifurcations* for flows on the line.
