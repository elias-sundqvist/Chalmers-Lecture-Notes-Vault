  - Fractal Dimension
---

 It is common to quantify scale-invariant structures using some fractal (non-integer) dimension $D$.
 
There are several ways to define the fractal dimension. 

Some of them are 
* [[Lyapunov Dimension]]
* [[Box-Counting Dimension]]
* [[Generalized Dimension Spectrum|Generalized Box-Counting Dimension]]

**Example: Successive zoom of particles on surface of turbulent flow**

In general $D$ must be calculated numerically. [[Strange Attractors|Strange attractors]] form in a [[Stretch And Fold Mechanism|stretching+floding process]] and show small-scale filamentary structure. A simple estimate of $D$ of a [[Strange Attractors|strange attractor]] us unity (for the dimension along the filaments) plus the fractal dimension of the patterns on a cross section orthogonal to the filaments.

Some mathematical idealisations of such cross-section patterns (e.g. [[Cantor Set|Cantor sets]]) have analytical expressions for the fractal dimension.
