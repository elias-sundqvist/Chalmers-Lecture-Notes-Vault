A fixed point can change stability through [[Bifurcation|bifurcations]]. Notably, for [[Transcritical Bifurcation|transcritical bifurcations]] this is the only thing that happens.  
In [[Linear 2D Flows]] the following three situations lead to a change in fixed point stability:

Cases a and b have $\text{Im}[\lambda_{1,2}]=0$ while case c has $\text{Im}[\lambda_{1,2}]\ne 0$. In [[Non-linear dynamical systems|non-linear systems]], case a corresponds to the local change in fixed points undergoing [[Saddle-Node Bifurcation|saddle-node]], [[Transcritical Bifurcation|transcritical]], and [[Pitchfork bifurcation|pitchfork]] [[Bifurcation|bifurcations]]. Case b is rare and therefore not so interesting. Case c is a [[Hopf Bifurcation]].
