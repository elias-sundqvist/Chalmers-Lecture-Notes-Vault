A Poincaré map can be interpreted as a [[Discrete Dynamical Systems|discrete dynamical system]] with a state space that is one dimension smaller than the original continuous dynamical system. Because it preserves many properties of periodic and quasiperiodic orbits of the original system and has a lower-dimensional state space, it is often used for analyzing the original system in a simpler way.

In Poincaré section $S$, the Poincaré map $P$ projects point $x$ onto point $P(x)$.
