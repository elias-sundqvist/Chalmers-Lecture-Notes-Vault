Two-timing is an extension of regular [[Perturbation Theory|perturbation theory]], where you split the time $t$ into multiple variables of different time scales, and treat them as independent variables. 

For an example of two-timing, see the [[Van Der Pol Oscillator With Small Mu#Solution Using Two-Timing]]


Let $\tau=t$ denote the fast time scale and $T=\mu t$ denote the slow time scale ($T$ is of order unity when $t\sim 1/\mu\gg 1$) and treat these as independent variables: $x=x(\tau, T)$. The reason this often works is that when we have a large time separation $T\gg\tau$, $x$ is roughly constant w.r.t. $T$ during the time scale $\tau$, and $x$ fluctuates so rapidly that the variable $\tau$ is effectively averaged during the time scale $T$.
