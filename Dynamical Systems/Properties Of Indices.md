1. A continuous transformation of curve $C$ to a new curve $C'$ without passing a [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] $\implies I_C=I_{C'}$
   **Proof:** $I_C$ must vary continuously, but since $I_C$ can only take discrete values it must remain constant. (Crossing a [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] could change the index because the orientation is undefined at the [[Fixed Points|fixed point]].)
2. A curve $C$ that does not enclose any fixed points has $I_C=0$.
   **Proof**: Shrink $C$ to a very small curve $C'$ in which vectors are close to parallel due to smoothness of the [[2D Flows|flow]] $\implies$ $I_C=I_{C'}=0$.
3. Reversing all arrows in vector field $(t\rightarrow -t)$ leaves index unchanged.
    **Proof**: All angles change from $\phi$ to $\phi+\pi$ $\implies$ Index unchanged.
4. The index of a [[Closed Orbit]] (i.e. the curve $C$ is the [[Closed Orbit]]), has $I_C=+1$.
    **Proof**: Flow is tangential to the curve at all times $\implies$ vector field rotates once as curve is traversed.
5. Let $x^*$ be an isolated fixed point. The [[Index Of A Fixed Point|index of a fixed point]] $I$ is equal to $I_C$ for any curve that encloses $x^*$ but does not enclose any other fixed points.
6. A curve $C$ surrounding $N$ [[Isolated Fixed Point|isolated fixed points]] has index $I_C=I_1+I_2+\dots+I_N$
