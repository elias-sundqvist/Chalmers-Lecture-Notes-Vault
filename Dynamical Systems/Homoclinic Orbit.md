A homoclinic orbit is a [[Trajectory|trajectory]] that connects a [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] with itself. 

An example of a homoclinic orbit can be seen in the [[Double-Well Potential]]

A homoclinic orbit is not strictly periodic since it takes an infinite amount of time to reach the fixed point. 

Homoclinic orbits can attract (or repel) other [[Trajectory|trajectories]], or act as divisors between regions of different kinds of dynamics ([[Separatrix|separatrices]]).
