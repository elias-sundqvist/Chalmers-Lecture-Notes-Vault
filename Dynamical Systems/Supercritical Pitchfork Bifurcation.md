A supercritical pitchfork bifurcation is a [[Pitchfork bifurcation]] which has one [[Stable]] branch splitting into one [[Unstable]]- and two [[Stable]] branches (the [[Unstable]] one being in the middle)

It may seem unlikely that three fixed points join at one point, but this often happens in systems with [[Mirror Symmetry|mirror symmetry]].

An example is the [[Buckling Of Elastic Ruler|buckling of an elastic ruler]].
