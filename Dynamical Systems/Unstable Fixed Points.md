![[Unstable Fixed Point Illustration.png]]

An *unstable fixed point* (also known as *repeller* or *source*) is a [[Fixed Points|fixed point]] where the surrounding flow is directed away from the fixed point (which means that small deviations from the fixed point grow with time, and that it is therefore [[Unstable]] to small perturbations.)
