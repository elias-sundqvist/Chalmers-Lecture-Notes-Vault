A volume conserving chaotic system is a [[Chaotic Systems|chaotic system]] that is [[Volume Conserving System|volume conserving]]

The sum of [[Lyapunov Exponent|lyapunov exponents]] is zero  ($\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\lambda_3=0$). 

[[Aperiodic Chaotic Trajectory|aperiodic chaotic trajectories]] (corresponding to different initial conditions) fill out space uniformly. 

Examples are [[Chaotic Advection Systems]] and [[Chaotic Hamiltonian Systems]]
