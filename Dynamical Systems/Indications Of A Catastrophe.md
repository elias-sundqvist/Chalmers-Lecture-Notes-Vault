In the [[Normal Form Of Saddle-Node Bifurcation|normal form of a saddle-node bifurcation]] (so for any [[Saddle-Node Bifurcation]]), in the case $r<0$, there are two fixed points $x^*=\pm \sqrt{-r}$ with stability exponents.
$\lambda=\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[r+x^2]\right|_{x^*}=2x^*=\pm 2\sqrt{-r}$, which become smaller close to the [[Bifurcation Point|bifurcation point]] $r=0$, i.e. the dynamics in the vicinity of the [[Fixed Points|fixed points]] is slow with time scale $\sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{-r}}$.
A small perturbation to the [[Stable]] fixed point in a system close to its bifurcation point decays very slowly. The systems have characteristic statistical behavior (long autocorrelation + large variance) that can be measured in experiments/observations, allowing for detection of imminent drastic changes ([[Catastrophe|("catatstophes")]]) to the system, some examples being perdiction of epileptic seizures, failure of ecosystems, climate change, and finance crashes.
