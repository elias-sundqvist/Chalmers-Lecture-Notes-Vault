Let $R$ be a simply connected region with a piecewise smooth boundary $C$ oriented counterclockwise (that is, $C$ is traversed *once* so that the region $R$ always lies to the *left*). If $M$ and $N$ have continuous first partial derivatives in an open region containing $R$, then

$\int_C M dx+N dy = \iint_R \left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\right)dA$
