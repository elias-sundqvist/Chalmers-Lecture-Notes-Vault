Perturbation theory comprises mathematical methods for fining an *approximate solution* to a problem by starting from the exact solution of a related, simpler problem.

A critical feature of the technique is a middle step that breaks the problem into *solvable*and *perturbative* parts. 


Perturbation theory develops an expression for the desired solutions in terms of a formal power series in some "small" parameter - known as a perturbation series - that quantifies the deviation from the exactly solvable problem. The leading term in this power series is the solution of the exactly solvable problem, while further terms describe the deviation in the solution, due to the deviation from the initial problem. Formally, we have for the approximation to the full solution A, a series in the small parameter (here called Îµ), like the following:

$A=A_0+\epsilon^1A_1+\epsilon^2A_2+\dots$

In this examples $A_0$ would be the known solution to the exactly solvable initial problem and $A_1,A_2,\dots$ represent the first-orderm second-order, and higher-order terms.

An approximate "perturbative solution" is obtained by truncating the series, often keeping only the first few terms, and expressing the final solution as a sum of the initial (exact) solution and the "first-order" perturbative correction.

$A\approx A_0+\epsilon A_1$.
